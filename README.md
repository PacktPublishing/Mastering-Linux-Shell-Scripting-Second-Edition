# Mastering Linux Shell Scripting - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Mastering Linux Shell Scripting - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/mastering-linux-shell-scripting-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788990554), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
In this book, you’ll discover everything you need to know to master shell scripting and make informed choices about the elements you employ. Get your systems updated to the latest Linux kernel and Bash shell to run your administration tasks efficiently. Get to grips with the fundamentals of creating and running a script in normal mode, and in debug mode. Learn about various conditional statements' code snippets, and realize the power of repetition and loops in your shell script. You will also learn to write complex shell scripts. This book will also deep dive into file system administration, directories, and system administration like networking, process management, user authentications, and package installation and regular expressions. Towards the end of the book, you will learn how to use Python as a BASH Scripting alternative. By the end of this book, you will know shell scripts at the snap of your fingers and will be able to automate and communicate with your system with keyboard expressions.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
if [ $file_compression = "L" ] ; then
tar_opt=$tar_l
elif [ $file_compression = "M" ]; then
tar_opt=$tar_m
else
tar_opt=$tar_h
fi
```

I assume that you have a little programming background in general. Even if you don't have
a programming background, the book will start from the beginning.
You should know some Linux basics such as the basic commands such as ls, cd, and which.
